# JTB-Resource-Pack-Converter
This is a shell script for Minecraft, it converts Java resource packs to Bedrock because as a texture artist, I'm tired of manually renaming all of my textures.

DO NOT USE; this script is unfinished and will ruin your resource pack, I will replace this with instructions when the converter is ready.
